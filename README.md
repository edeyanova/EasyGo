Intelligent Tourist Guide

The developed master thesis on EasyGo - Intelligent Travel Guides is a functioning prototype with trends for improvement and addition of new functionalities.
The concept of EasyGo is to create a Web-based, intelligent excursion system that can be retrieved using crawlers that are currently browsing several predefined sites. The recommendation is based on answers to questions asked to the user.
It was a new type of solution that combines business intuition with Artificial Intelligence. The main task that was solved is for many users and many of the services or products offered to recommend content that will be interesting and relevant to the different users of the system based on the knowledge we have about them - which are set on the home page of the system. The solution to this task has made it possible for an electronic tourist system to understand the preferences of its users and direct them to the right destinations. Research has shown that such systems have managed to show a wider selection of interesting proposals and have the potential to increase the revenue for the tourism sector.
